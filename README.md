# BEARING-FAULTS-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CNN
The Data Set is taken from: https://engineering.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/download-data-file  
-the dataset is IN matlab FORMAT 
.We only take the 12k sampling rate of drive end dataset at 1 hp for this project 
-drive end referring to the drive end part of the motor as that is where the accelerometer is placed
-The CNN model makes prediction directly from the time domain data
-In the code, the frequency domain graph is plotted using FFT, although the frequency domain data is not use in the deep learning model. It was simply there for learning process
